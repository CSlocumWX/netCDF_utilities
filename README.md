What are my NetCDF utilities?
-----------------------------

Simple put, my utilities are snippets of code I constantly reused
in my Python workflow to read and write NetCDF files. I posted
the files here so others could use them. Hopefully, others find
them useful.

Installation
------------

`python setup.py install`

Usage
-----

Coming soon! Look at the example in ./test
